Syncopation,"The degree of of syncopation in the song (roughly equateable with ’rhythmic complexity’). Syncopation is when rhythmic accents align with metrically weak positions of a metrical beat structure (e.g., having accents half way between when people tap their foot rather than directly aligned with the foot taps).",syncopate,for dancing,Industrialised,Expert Annotation

Tension," The degree to which the passage is perceived to build and release tension via changes in melodic contour, harmonic progression, rhythm, motivic development, accent, or instrumentation. If so, the song is annotated with a value of 1.",tension,to heal illness,Industrialised,Expert Annotation
Vibrato present,"Presence of vibrato in the singing. Vibrato is a rapid, slight oscillation in pitch that is typically perceived as adding intensity.",vibrato,to heal illness,Industrialised,Expert Annotation
Variety in pitch,"A pitch class is the group of pitches that sound equivalent at different octaves, such as all the Cs, not just middle C. This variable, an indicator of melodic variety, counts the number of pitch classes that appear at least once in the song.",pitch_class_variety,for dancing,Industrialised,Transcription

Overall direction of motion,"Number of rising melodic intervals divided by number of intervals that are either rising or falling—that is, fraction of moving intervals that are rising (unisons are ignored).

Estimated simplified mode of the transcription,"Quality or mode of the transcription (major or minor) based on the Krumhansl-Schmuckler key-finding algorithm.
